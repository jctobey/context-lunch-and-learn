## React Context Through the Lens of Pricing Intel :mag_right:

### We like that feature- let's put it _everywhere_

</Steps>

---

### I don't do the pricing intel- why do I care?

---

import lookAtThisGraph from "./images/look-at-this-graph.png";

### Challenge

<Steps>

- Call pricing endpoints once for each page

- Only re-render the components that care about pricing

</Steps>

<img
  src={lookAtThisGraph}
  alt="Graph"
  style={{ height: "1200px", width: "1200px" }}
/>

---

### Pricing Iterations

<Steps>

- Lifted up state to PricingIntelChartContent :x:

- Abstracted logic to handle fetching, parsing and managing pricing intel to a hook :warning:

- Wrapped page containers in context provider/consumer :trophy:

</Steps>

---

# Show us the effing code!

---

### in React-speak, super dope

<Steps>

- Provider's value prop change only re-renders context consumers

- Context consumers use useContext hook :muscle:

</Steps>

---

### Tangible Developer and Application Benefits

<Steps>

- Exactly one of each pricing request fires off per page when inputs change

- Dropped embedded pricing into new shipment in 15 minutes

</Steps>

---

### Challenges I've Encountered

<Steps>

- Context value and component state are not always isomorphic

- Moving Embedded Pricing from Financials to Bids on Shipment Details

- **Hypothetical**: What if there were multiple providers in Shipment Details container?

</Steps>

### Context is not a panacea

<Steps>

- Refactor your components to make them more compositional

- Abstract complex component logic to a hook

</Steps>
